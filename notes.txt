javascript
const express = require("express");
const path = require("path");
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

app.get("/form", (req, res) => {
    console.log("its a get request");
    res.sendFile("form.html", { root: path.join(__dirname, "public") });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
});




Explanation:
path.join(__dirname, "public"): This constructs the absolute path to the public directory.

{ root: path.join(__dirname, "public") }: This specifies the root directory for sendFile to find the file.

This should resolve the syntax error and correctly serve your form.html file from the public directory. Let me know if you encounter any more issues or need further assistance!
